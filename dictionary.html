									<span id="benchmarking" class="word">Benchmarking</span>
								</td>
								<td>
									<span>A benchmark is a standard against which the performance of a security, mutual fund or investment manager can be measured. Generally, broad market and market-segment stock and bond indexes are used for this purpose.</span>
								</td>

						<tr>
							<p class="line">
								<td>
									<span id="social-license" class="word">Social License</span>
								</td>
								<td>
									<span>The social license to operate (SLO), or simply social license, refers to the ongoing acceptance of a company or industry's standard business practices and operating procedures by its employees, stakeholders and the general public. The concept of social license is closely related to the concept of sustainability and the triple bottom line.</span>

									<span id="governance" class="word">Governance</span>
								</td>
								<td>
									<span>Corporate governance is the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a firm is directed and controlled. Corporate governance essentially involves balancing the interests of a company's many stakeholders, such as shareholders, senior management executives, customers, suppliers, financiers, the government, and the community. Since corporate governance also provides the framework for attaining a company's objectives, it encompasses practically every sphere of management, from action plans and internal controls to performance measurement and corporate disclosure.</span>

						<tr>
							<p class="line">
								<td>
									<span id="risk-management" class="word">Risk-Management</span>
								</td>
								<td>
									<span>Risk management occurs everywhere in the financial world. It occurs when an investor buys low-risk government bonds over riskier corporate bonds, when a fund manager hedges his currency exposure with currency derivatives, and when a bank performs a credit check on an individual before issuing a personal line of credit. Stockbrokers use financial instruments like options and futures, and money managers use strategies like portfolio and investment diversification to mitigate or effectively manage risk.</span>

						</tr>
						<tr>
							<p class="line">
								<td>
									<span id="conflicts-of-interes" class="word">Conflicts Of Interes</span>
								</td>
								<td>
									<span>A conflict of interest occurs when an entity or individual becomes unreliable because of a clash between personal (or self-serving) interests and professional duties or responsibilities. Such a conflict occurs when a company or person has a vested interest, such as money, status, knowledge, relationships, or reputation, which puts into question whether their actions, judgment, and/or decision-making can be unbiased. When such a situation arises, the party is usually asked to remove themselves, and it is often legally required of them.</span>

							</p>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<p class="line">
								<td>
									<span id="all-in-costs" class="word">All In Costs</span>
								</td>
								<td>
									<span>An all-in cost is every cost involved in a financial transaction. All-in costs can be used to explain the total fees and interest included in a financial transaction, such as a loan or CD purchase, or in a securities trade. By comparing all-in costs, investors and borrowers can more easily compare net gain potential.</span>

# About this repo

I have created this HTML site in the early days of my HTML/CSS learning process.

Moreover, I found it interesting to do my Social Sciences (School) Project this way rather than classical approach.

So, I am thinking to archive this now but as you know, you are free to learn from it.

Thank you very much for coming here... :)
